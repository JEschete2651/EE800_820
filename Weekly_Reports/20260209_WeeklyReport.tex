	\section*{Accomplishments This Week}
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Met with Dr. Yett to discuss project direction and proposal scope
		\item Completed the research proposal by the February 10 deadline, pending review and approval.
		\item Ordered STM32 Nucleo-L476RG microcontrollers for use as beacon targets
		\item Set up Vivado development environment for the Nexys A7-100T
		\item Began preliminary literature review on FPGA-based signal processing and integrated curriculum design
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section*{Goals for Next Week}
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Collect and review research papers from the last five years on FPGA-based RF signal processing, embedded system integration, and applied ML for signal classification
		\item Evaluate and select a radio module for the beacon subsystem (LoRa, sub-GHz ISM, or alternative)
		\item Begin outlining the curriculum module sequence based on literature findings
		\item Confirm STM32 delivery timeline and verify board functionality upon arrival
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section*{Potential Blockers}
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Limited published work combining FPGA and ML in an educational or signal processing context may narrow the literature base
		\item STM32 delivery timeline is uncertain and could delay initial hardware integration testing
		\item Radio module selection remains open, which blocks detailed system architecture and interface design decisions
	\end{itemize}
